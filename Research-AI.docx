Draft: AI Integration Research Summary for MVP (GitHub-ready)
Purpose
The aim of the AI integration is to enhance the Venture Pipeline Management System by automatically analyzing venture submissions, pitch decks, and inclusion-related data. This would support the MIV team in evaluating ventures more effectively, even with limited manual resources.

Proposed Use Case
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and score GEDSI (Gender Equality, Disability, and Social Inclusion) relevance from venture-submitted documents (e.g., business plans, pitch decks). The AI model could auto-generate:

GEDSI summary

Readiness assessment score

Red flags or inclusion gaps

Technology Considered
OpenAI GPT-4 API for text summarization and classification

LangChain for building AI pipelines with context-aware prompts

Airtable Scripting / Zapier for automating results back into the database

Streamlit / Flask (optional microservice frontend)

Next Steps
Prepare a dataset of sample venture descriptions

Design prompt templates for GEDSI scoring

Create proof-of-concept script using GPT API

Document score outputs and recommendation system
